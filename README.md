# VIBR - Visual Image-Based Recommendation

VIBR is a web application that uses Google's Vision API and Spotify's API to provide users with song recommendations based on the characteristics present in a user-uploaded image.





## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide song recommendations based on image analysis using the Google Vision API and Spotify API. The platform (available at vibr.herokuapp.com) allows users to upload an image, which the system will analyze and use to generate relevant song recommendations.


## Technology Stack

* Flask: Backend web framework
* JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML, CSS: Front-end technologies
* Google Vision API: Image analysis tool
* Spotify API: Music streaming service


## Key Features

* Image analysis and tag generation
* Personalized song recommendations based on image analysis
* User-friendly front-end interface for uploading images and receiving song recommendations


## How it Works

The platform is designed to provide users with personalized song recommendations based on the content of their uploaded images. Once a user uploads an image, the system uses the Google Vision API to analyze the image and generate tags based on its content. These tags are then used to query the Spotify API and retrieve relevant song recommendations.

The front-end interface is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive process for uploading images and receiving song recommendations. Once a user has uploaded an image, the system will display the recommended songs on the page. Users can then listen to the songs directly on the platform or add them to their Spotify playlists.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development and is actively being worked on by the participants listed below. The goal is to refine the image analysis algorithm, improve the recommendation engine, and add new features such as emotion analysis and integration with additional music streaming services.


## Getting Started

To get started, visit the platform at vibr.herokuapp.com and upload an image to receive relevant song recommendations.
